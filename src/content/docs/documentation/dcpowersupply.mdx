title: "Dc Power Supply Fixed Output"
description: "The APS Series power supplies deliver stable and precise outputs for diverse testing and development applications, offering models with various voltage and current combinations, including 0-5V/1A, ±15V/1A, and 0-30V/2A. With 3-digit digital panel meters for accurate voltage and current measurements, they feature a meter accuracy of ±0.1% ± 3 counts. The supplies ensure excellent regulation with ±0.05% line and load stability, and low ripple/noise (<2mV RMS). Built-in overload and short circuit protection, along with optional relay protection, ensure safe operation.
The floating output polarity provides flexibility, making them ideal for laboratory use and testing environments."
