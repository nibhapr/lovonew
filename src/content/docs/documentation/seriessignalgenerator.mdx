title: "series signal generator"
description: "This device offers sine, square, triangular, and pulse waveforms with a 16-character LCD display
 showing frequency and output. It uses a DDS design with a crystal oscillator for exceptional frequency accuracy,
covering ranges from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz, 0.2 Hz to 2 MHz, and 0.3 Hz to 3 MHz. Both input and output are fully protected, 
with the output amplifier safeguarded against short circuits and overloads. A high-frequency active filter minimizes
sine wave distortion. It features a variable DC offset with ON/OFF control and a standard 50-ohm output impedance. 
It features a variable DC offset with ON/OFF control and a standard 50-ohm output impedance. 
Compact and portable, it's designed for reliable performance."
