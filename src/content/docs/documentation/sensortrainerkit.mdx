title: "Sensor trainer kit"
description: "The Sensor Trainer Kit includes various sensors such as Thermocouple, RTD (PT-100), Load Cell, Strain Gauge, LVDT, Smoke Sensor, and Speed Sensor. It features a proximity sensor with a 20mm range, onboard excitation generator, and a displacement jig with micrometer for precise measurements. The kit also includes a heating rod, beaker, and weights up to 3kg, along with an instrumentation amplifier. Magnetic and photo pickup transducers, optical sensors with IR LED, and photo transistors are provided for advanced experimentation. Additionally, inductive and capacitive sensors with LED and buzzer indicators are included. This versatile kit is ideal for practical learning of sensor applications and measurement systems.."
