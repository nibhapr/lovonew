title: "Op-Amp Trainer Kit"
description: "This power supply and function generator system offers versatile outputs of +/-5V/1A, +/-12V/1A, 
and a variable range from +/-1.2V to +/-15V using the onboard IC 741. 
The 3-digit digital meter provides precise voltage and frequency readings, 
while the function generator covers a frequency range from 1Hz to 100KHz with sine and square wave outputs.
It features 1K and 10K potentiometers, multi-color 2mm sockets for easy connections, 
and is mounted on a durable glass epoxy printed board. Ideal for studying OP-AMP parameters,
it supports inverting amplifiers, non-inverting amplifiers, and voltage followers. 
The system comes in a powder-coated enclosure with an instruction manual for easy use."
